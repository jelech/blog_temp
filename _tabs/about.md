👨‍💻 I'm a Backend Engineer with four years of professional experience. I specialize in **Golang** and have a robust skill set that includes **Python**, **Docker**, relational and NoSQL databases, game server development, and AI-enhanced engineering projects.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- **lego**: A robust game server framework designed to handle high loads and provide real-time interactions.
- **cServer**: A back-end server written purely in C for performance-critical applications.
- **next-c**: A versatile data collection and scheduling platform that streamlines processes across various data sources.
- **pangolin-swaper**: A high-performance, distributed system for multi-source data transfer, ensuring efficient and reliable data handling.
